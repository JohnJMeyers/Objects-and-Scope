## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.


### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope:
Scope refers to an objects accessibility in relation to its location. Global variables are accessible, and can be reassigned, from anywhere on the page. Local variables exist only within the block of code that they are declared in. Once the block of code is executed, they are no longer accessible.

#### Hoisting:
Hoisting refers to the JavaScript interpreter moving all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope. Variable and function assignments remain where they are. If a variable or function expression exists, the interpreter will separate the declarations from the assignments and move the declarations to the top of their scope.

#### Compartmentalization:
Compartmentalization refers to the act of isolating certain lines of code to their local scope so they cannot be altered or interfere with any other declarations or assignments.
